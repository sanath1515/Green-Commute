# Green-Commute

## Introduction

Green Commute is a cutting-edge platform that revolutionizes the traditional job search experience, combining the functionality of renowned job suggestion websites like LinkedIn, Naukri, and Indeed with a unique eco-conscious twist. This innovative project stands out by offering an additional feature - the provision of 'Green Commute Routes'. These routes are carefully selected based on lower Air Quality Index (AQI) levels, ensuring a healthier and more environmentally friendly journey to work.

The application not only suggests suitable jobs based on the user's skills, experience, and location but also emphasizes the importance of a safe and sustainable commute. It intelligently recommends various transportation mediums that align with the goal of reducing carbon footprints, such as cycling, walking, public transportation, or electric vehicles. 

Moreover, Green Commute takes a user-centric approach by displaying job opportunities in the vicinity of the user, considering their specific requirements and preferences. It goes a step further by highlighting jobs that not only match the user's professional profile but also have safer, more sustainable commuting routes. This feature is particularly beneficial for those who prioritize health, safety, and environmental responsibility in their daily commute.

Overall, Green Commute serves as a beacon for sustainable employment, encouraging users to make eco-friendly choices in their professional lives. It's not just a job search platform; it's a tool for fostering a sustainable lifestyle, enhancing both personal well-being and environmental health.
